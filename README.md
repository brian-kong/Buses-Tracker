## Buses-Tracker

An Android application that maps the location of stops and bus routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system. The user's location is plotted on the map and highlights the nearest bus stop. It retrieves real time arrival information using the TransLink Open API. This application was created as a final project for CPSC 210 at UBC.

## Usage 
  - The closest stop to you will be highlighted and displayed at the bottom of the screen.
  - Clicking on a stop will display upcoming bus arrival times and display its route.

## Successes:
• Wrote JSON parsers to retrieve arrival, routes, and stops information from TransLink APIs.
• Showed buses location, stops and routes on the map.
• Completed the implementation of the Android application that uses a mapping API to present information to the user.
• Tested the abstractions and data in JSON using JUnit test.
